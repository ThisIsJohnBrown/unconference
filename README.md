# Overview

This is a project for the [#HackingFromHome Hackathon](https://mattermost.com/hackfest2020/).

This project is inspired by the unconferences of the past, in the before times, when we could gather together to learn from each other and share ideas. That has become so hard during the Covid-19 moment we're living through, because there aren't many directly interactive spaces for this sort of conversation.

## The Big Idea

This is an attempt to create a safe, free-form environment online to gather, share, and present ideas.

## Participants

Currently, it's just me! But if you want to work on this with me, join [the Mattermost instance](https://hackathon.cloud.mattermost.com/) or email me!

## Design files

If you want to see any design files we're working on, there's [an open Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/S5qv4XPBP7dyHdeJ9i0w2W/Unconference-Design-Ideas).

# Project

As it stands now, this project will mainly be a website wrapper for an instance of [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/).

After a baseline is set with the website, we will focus on forking and updating [jitsi-meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet) in order to extend features and functionality to more closely align with the desired presentational environment.
